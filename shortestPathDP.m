% Note 1: Valid for directed/undirected network.
% Note 2: if links have weights, they are treated as distances.

% INPUTs: L - (cost/path lengths matrix), s - (start/source node),
%                                       t - (end/destination node)
%                                 steps - number of arcs allowable
% OUTPUTS:
%       route - sequence of nodes on optimal path, at current stage
%       route(k,i).path - best route from "i" to destination "t" in "k" steps
%       route_st - best route from "s" to "t"
%       J_st - optimal cost function (path length) from "s" to "t"
%       J(1,i) - distance from node "i" to "t" in "k" steps
