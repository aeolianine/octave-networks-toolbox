% This function returns the betweenness measure of all vertices.
% Betweenness centrality measure: number of shortest paths running through a vertex.
%
% Note 1: Valid for a general graph (multiple shortest paths possible).
% Note 2: Currently this function is quite slow, because of
%         findAllShortestPaths.m. This is especially true for dense
%         graphs.
%
% INPUTS: adjacency or distances matrix (nxn)
% OUTPUTS: betweeness vector for all vertices (1xn)
%
% Other routines used: numNodes.m, adj2adjL.m, simpleDijkstra.m, findAllShortestPaths.m

function betw = nodeBetweenness(adj)

    n = numNodes(adj);
    spaths = inf(n, n);
    betw = zeros(1, n);
    adjL = adj2adjL(adj);

    for i = 1:n
        uB = simpleDijkstra(adj, i);

        for j = 1:n

            if i == j
                continue;
            end

            [allPaths, ~] = findAllShortestPaths(adjL, i, j, uB(j), allPaths = {}, path = []);
            spaths(i, j) = length(allPaths);

            % for all paths in allPaths, parse out the path:
            for p = 1:length(allPaths)
                path = strsplit(allPaths{p}, '-');
                pathvec = [];

                for x = 2:length(path)% skip the first one
                    pathvec = [pathvec str2num(path{x})];
                end

                betw(pathvec(2:length(pathvec) - 1)) = betw(pathvec(2:length(pathvec) - 1)) + 1 / spaths(i, j);
            end

        end % end of j=1:n

    end % end of i=1:n

    % this last step is just additional normalization, and is arbitrary
    betw = betw / (2 * nchoosek(n, 2));
