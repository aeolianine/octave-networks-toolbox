% Returns the leaf edges of the graph: edges with one adjacent edge only.
%
% Note 1: For a directed graph, leaf edges are those that "flow into" a leaf node.
% Note 2: There could be other definitions of leaves, for example: farthest away from a given root node.
% Note 3: Edges that are self-loops are not considered leaf edges.
% Note 4: Single floating disconnected edges are not considered to be leaf edges.
%
% Input: adjacency matrix, nxn
% Output: set of leaf edges: a (num edges x 2) matrix where every row contains the leaf edge nodal indices

function edges = leafEdges(adj)

    adj = int8(adj > 0);

    lves = find(sum(adj) == 1); % same as leaf_nodes.m

    edges = [];

    for i = 1:length(lves)
        edges = [edges; find(adj(:, lves(i)) == 1), lves(i)];
    end
