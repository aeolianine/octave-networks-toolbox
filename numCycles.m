% Calculate the number of independent cycles (use L = m-n+c)
%      where L = num cycles, m - num edges, n - num nodes,
%                      c - number of connected components
% This is also known as the "cyclomatic number": the number of edges
% that needs to be removed so that the graph doesn't have cycles.

% INPUTS: adjacency matrix, nxn
% OUTPUTs: number of independent cycles (or cyclomatic number)

function L = numCycles(adj)

    n = numNodes(adj);
    m = numEdges(adj);
    comp_mat = findConnComp(adj);

    L = m - n + length(comp_mat);
