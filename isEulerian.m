% Check if a graph is Eulerian, i.e. it has an Eulerian circuit
% "A connected undirected graph is Eulerian if and only if every graph vertex has an even degree."
% "A connected directed graph is Eulerian if and only if every graph vertex has equal in- and out- degree."
% Note 1: Assume that the graph is connected.
% Note 2: If there is an Eulerian trail, it is reported.

% INPUTS: adjacency matrix, nxn
% OUTPUTS: Boolean variable, 0 or 1
