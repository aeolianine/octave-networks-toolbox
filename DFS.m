% Find all paths from a start to an end node,
% bounded by a constant, using depth-first-search.
%
% Source: Idea from 6.002x, Spring 2014.
% Note: Uses recursion.
%
% INPUTs: graph structure (a nxn adjacency matrix)
%         s - start node
%         e - end node
%         upperBound = 5, some constant bounding the
%                    length of the path; typically size(adj,1)-1
%         allPaths = {}, path = []; are by default empty,
%                                  serving the recursion
%
% OUTPUTs: a list {} of all shortest paths from "s" to "e",
%                                shorter than "upperBound"

function allPaths = DFS(graph, s, e, allPaths = {}, path = [], upperBound = 5)

    path = [path s];

    if s == e

        if length(path) - 1 <= upperBound % this can be modified to include edge weights [(1,2,{}),..]
            allPaths{length(allPaths) + 1} = path;
        end

    else

        if length(path) - 1 <= upperBound

            kneigh = kneighbors(graph, s, 1);

            for node = 1:length(kneigh)

                node = kneigh(node);

                if length(find(path == node)) == 0 % avoid cycles
                    allPaths = DFS(graph, node, e, allPaths, path, upperBound);
                end

            end
