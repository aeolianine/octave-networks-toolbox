% Compute the average degree of a node in a graph, defined as
% 2 times the number of edges divided by the number of nodes
%          (every edge is counted towards the degrees twice).
%
% Inputs: adjacency matrix, nxn
% Outputs: float, the average degree, a number between 0 and max(sum(adj))
%
% Note: The average degree is related to the link density, namely:
%       link_density = ave_degree/(n-1), where n is the number of nodes
%
% Other routines used: numNodes.m, numEdges.m

function k = averageDegree(adj)

    k = 2 * numEdges(adj) / numNodes(adj);
